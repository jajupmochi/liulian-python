Welcome to the LIULIAN documentation — a Research OS for spatiotemporal model experimentation.

## What is LIULIAN?

LIULIAN is a Python library that provides a unified, task-driven framework for training, evaluating, and performing inference with time-series, graph, and spatiotemporal models. It is designed for researchers who need reproducible experiment pipelines with minimal boilerplate.
